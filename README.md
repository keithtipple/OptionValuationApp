# Options Valuation Library
A library of different types of options and option valuation models

---

This project consists of a library of option valuation models as well as a console app that demonstrates how to use the library.

Currently, the Monte Carlo valuation method is supported along with variance reduction techniques that include antithetic variables and stratification.

Vanilla and binary options can be created and valued using the valuation models. They can also be valued using their analytic solution to the Black-Scholes partial differential equation that defines the movement of the underlying security.

For examples on how to create and value options using the library, please refer to the code in the console app.
